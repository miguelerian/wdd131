            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Proposed Site Name:</strong> Taqueria Fat-Fit</p>
            <p>
                The name represents a traditional neighborhood taco stand located on a street corner, a common and familiar concept in Mexican cities. It is easy to remember,
                culturally relevant, and clearly communicates the type of business.

            <p><strong>Optional domain name:</strong> taqueriafat-fit.com</p>

            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to promote a local taco stand by providing essential
                information such as the menu, location, contact details, business history, promotions,
                and images of customers enjoying the food. The site will also help establish an official
                online presence for the business and serve as a foundation for future growth.

            <h2>Reason for Choosing This Project</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this project because my sister is the owner of this taco stand, and I want to
                surprise her by creating a professional website for her business. This project also
                provides a meaningful opportunity to apply the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills learned
                in this course while developing a real-world product with long-term value.
